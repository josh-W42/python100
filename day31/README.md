# Flashcard GUI Applicaiton

### Overview:
Build a GUI application that allows users to study flashcards.

### Specifications For Game:
- An "I got it right" button, when pressed, it removes the flashcard from the deck.
- An "I did not get this right or Idk" button, when pressed, the game moves on onto the next card.
- A large "card" that displays one side of the flashcard, for 2 seconds or so then "flips to the backside" to reveal the answer.

### Opportunity For Expansion:

  - Button, file select, upload, parse, rerender.
